# Password Generator 

## My password generator is created to generate a random password that meets the user requirements.  To accomplish this, I need to add the following criteria:

-Button will prompt a questions to the user
-Upon answer, prompt for additional clarifying questions, upon answer, must include one of each true answer:
    -how many characters
    -uppercase
    -lowercase
    -special characters
    -numbers
-Return random password meeting these criteria
-Ask to start again?
-Do we want to store in local setting?
-Do we want to be able to recall this data?
